# 🚗 Autonomous Driving Agent for TORCS

An AI-powered **Autonomous Driving Agent** for [TORCS (The Open Racing Car Simulator)](http://torcs.sourceforge.net/), capable of completing laps with minimal deviation under strict real-time constraints.  
This project combines **Imitation Learning** (from expert driving data) with **Reinforcement Learning** techniques, using deep neural networks for perception-to-action mapping.

---

## 📌 Overview

The aim of this project was to design, train, and deploy an autonomous driving agent in a simulated racing environment. By leveraging **human driving demonstrations** and **reward-driven policy improvement**, the agent learns both smooth control and optimal racing strategies.

---

## 🛠 Core Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**  
  - [Keras](https://keras.io/) – Deep learning framework for building the driving policy network  
  - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) – Backend for Keras models  
  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) – Preprocessing and normalization  
  - NumPy, Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Simulator:** TORCS – High-performance car racing simulator with real-time control capabilities

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

### 1. **Imitation Learning**
- Collected driving data from expert human drivers in TORCS.
- Trained a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** to map sensor inputs → steering, acceleration, and gear commands.
- Used **StandardScaler** (scikit-learn) for normalizing sensor readings.

### 2. **Reinforcement Learning Enhancement**
- Applied **reward shaping** to encourage smooth driving and discourage off-track deviations.
- Implemented **curriculum learning** to gradually increase track complexity.

## 🔄 System Pipeline

1. **Data Collection:**  
   Captured driving logs (sensor readings + control actions) from human experts.

2. **Preprocessing:**  
   - Normalized inputs.
   - Prepared training datasets.

3. **Model Training:**  
   - Trained MLP model on driving logs (imitation learning).
   - Fine-tuned with reinforcement learning for performance optimization.

4. **Integration with TORCS:**  
   - The trained model predicts control actions in real-time.
   - Implemented **smooth control logic** to avoid jittery steering.

5. **Evaluation:**  
   Agent tested on various tracks for stability and lap completion.
